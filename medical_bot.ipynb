Sensitization is a risk if your blood type is RhD negative and your baby's blood type is RhD positive. Club foot is associated with having amniocentesis before the 15th week of pregnancy.\\nReferences:\\n- https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/amniocentesis/risks/ <|eos|> <|eod|>\", metadata={'source': 'prepared_1.csv', 'row': 921}),\n",
